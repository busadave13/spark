name: feature-reviewer
description: Read-only reviewer for feature spec files. Validates FEAT-NNN-*.md files under the feature/ directory against the spark feature template by running deterministic structural checks (F01–F12+) per file, then reports findings by severity. Does not modify or fix files — output only. Use whenever a user asks to "review the feature specs", "check FEAT-001", "validate feature docs", or "find issues in the feature specs".

# Feature Review

Validates one or more `FEAT-NNN-*.md` files against the spark feature template using
a deterministic checklist. Produces a per-file findings table and reports issues by severity.

This skill reviews feature specs only. It never modifies `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
or ADR files. To review upstream documents use `prd-reviewer`,
`architecture-reviewer`, or `adr-reviewer`.

---

## Step 1: Resolve path and collect feature files

Accept a path to a specific feature file, the `feature/` directory, or a docs root.

- If the path ends with `FEAT-*.md`, review that single file. `{docs-root}` = grandparent of the file (parent of `feature/`).
- If the path ends with `feature/` or is a directory named `feature`, review all `FEAT-*.md` files within it. `{docs-root}` = parent of that directory.
- If the path is any other directory, look for `{path}/feature/FEAT-*.md`. If found, `{docs-root}` = `{path}`.
- If no path is given, ask the user which project to review, then use the provided `{feature-root}` folder path or ask the user for the feature spec location.

In a single parallel call, read:
- all resolved `FEAT-*.md` files in full
- `{docs-root}/PRD.md` — §3 personas and §5 features only (read-only reference)
- `{docs-root}/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Key Architectural Decisions and Layers & Boundaries only (read-only reference)

---

## Step 2: Run review checks

Evaluate each check as **PASS** or **FAIL** for every feature file independently.

A check is **FAIL only when its exact FAIL condition is met**. Do not infer, extrapolate,
or flag issues not listed. If a section is genuinely absent from a file, every check
targeting that section is FAIL for that file.

### Check table

| ID  | Target | Check | FAIL condition |
|-----|--------|-------|----------------|
| F01 | First line | SPARK marker present | First line is not exactly `<!-- SPARK -->` |
| F02 | Header | All metadata fields present | Any of Type, Version, Created, Last Updated, Owner, Project, Status is missing or blank |
| F03 | Header | Version format valid | Does not match `\d+\.\d+` (e.g. `1.0`, `2.3`) — three-part versions are non-conforming |
| F04 | Header | Status valid | Value is not exactly `Draft`, `Approved`, or `Implemented` |
| F05 | Goal | Goal section present and filled | Section is absent, blank, or contains only template placeholders |
| F06 | Goal | Goal is 2–3 sentences | Fewer than 2 or more than 3 sentences in the Goal section |
| F07 | Motivation | Motivation section present and filled | Section is absent, blank, or contains only template placeholders |
| F08 | Motivation | Motivation references a PRD goal or FR | No reference to a PRD goal, FR number, or user pain point from the PRD |
| F09 | User Stories | At least 1 user story present | Section is absent or contains only template placeholders |
| F10 | User Stories | Every story references a persona defined in PRD §3 | Any story uses a role name not present as a persona in `PRD.md` §3 |
| F11 | Acceptance Criteria | At least 3 criteria present | Fewer than 3 checklist items present |
| F12 | Acceptance Criteria | At least 1 error case criterion | No criterion describes an error, failure, or missing-input condition |
| F13 | Acceptance Criteria | No untestable criteria | Any criterion uses vague qualifiers with no observable equivalent (`quickly`, `easily`, `correctly`, `appropriately`) |
| F14 | API / Interface Definition | Section present or explicitly marked N/A | Section is absent with no N/A explanation |
| F15 | API / Interface Definition | Error responses documented | Section is filled but contains no error status codes or error response shapes |
| F16 | Data Model | Section present or explicitly marked N/A | Section is absent with no N/A explanation |
| F17 | Edge Cases & Error Handling | Table present with at least 1 row | Section is absent or table has zero data rows |
| F18 | Out of Scope | At least 2 explicit items | Fewer than 2 explicit out-of-scope items listed |
| F19 | Dependencies | Section present | Section is absent entirely |
| F20 | Any | No Open Questions section | A section named "Open Questions" (or similar) exists anywhere in the document |
| F21 | Any | No unresolved TBDs or placeholders | `[TBD]`, `{PLACEHOLDER}`, or unfilled template placeholder text (e.g. `{FEATURE_NAME}`) appears anywhere |
| F22 | Any | No upstream conflict | Feature introduces a goal, persona, or architectural decision not present in `PRD.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| F23 | Header | Type value valid | `**Type**` value is not exactly `FEATURE` |

### Severity mapping

Apply these mechanically — do not override based on document context.

| Severity | Check IDs |
|----------|-----------|
| **High** | F01, F02, F03, F04, F11, F20, F22, F23 |
| **Medium** | F05, F06, F07, F08, F09, F10, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19 |
| **Low** | F21 |

---

## Step 3: Present findings

List only FAIL results, grouped by feature file (alphabetical by filename), sorted High
then Medium within each file.

```
| ID  | File                          | Issue                                                  | Severity |
|-----|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| F11 | FEAT-001-user-auth-flow.md    | Only 2 acceptance criteria; minimum is 3               | High     |
| F12 | FEAT-001-user-auth-flow.md    | No error case criterion present                        | Medium   |
| F08 | FEAT-002-export-csv.md        | Motivation does not reference a PRD goal or FR number  | Medium   |
```

If all checks pass across all reviewed feature files, report:
`"✅ All feature specs passed all review checks."` and stop.

---

## Step 4: Report completion

```
✅ Feature review complete.

- Feature specs reviewed: {N}
- Checks run per spec: 23
- Issues found: {N}
```

This agent is read-only. It does not apply fixes or modify feature files.
To apply fixes, use `feature-editor`.
